I am a software engineer at Cisco and a recent graduate of Georgia Tech's [OMSCS](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) program.

At Cisco, I develop cybersecurity monitoring solutions for the [Stealthwatch Cloud](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/stealthwatch-cloud/index.html) product. My work includes researching and implementing security detections for all major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).

In OMSCS, I specialized in Machine Learning, focusing on the following key areas:

* Machine learning theory and algorithms
    * Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
* Data analytics and visualization
* Operating systems, networking, and information security
* Software development methodologies

A few of my OMSCS projects are highlighted in this site. Please bear in mind that, due to the academic honor code constraints of a scalable, online master's degree program, I cannot share project deliverables directly. Sharing permissions differ among courses and projects, and I have carefully followed those permissions here.
