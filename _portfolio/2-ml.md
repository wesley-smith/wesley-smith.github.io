_Note_: Each of these projects required a paper as the main deliverable, so my analysis is limited to high-level takeaways. All code for this course, for which the sole purpose is to run experiments, is allowed to be shared without restriction. As such, I've included links to my public GitHub repositories for each.

To add:
* Description of projects with links to repos and summary of key findings
