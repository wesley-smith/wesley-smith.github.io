This was a group project with [James Bonifield](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonifield/), [Chris Comfort](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrismc8045bb5/), and [Diego Carvallo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-carvallo/) for [CSE6242](https://poloclub.github.io/#cse6242). The data visualization linked below shows a combination of three climate-related datasets:

* Temperature
* CO2 emissions
* Power generation mix

Our objective was to provide users with relevant and easy-to-digest climate/energy data for their locality (in the US). It was a significant challenge to digest such diverse datasets and display them in a user-friendly way.

The visualization is built with [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) and [Dash](https://plot.ly/dash/) - Python toolkits for building interactive visualizations. Please visit the following link to view and interact.

**Note:** Please allow around 1-2 minutes for the page to load. Since this is only a prototype, all datasets are pre-loaded, requiring significant time for data transfer.
